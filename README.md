# Simple FPS Game Contorller
This is a first person controller I have made and use for my games. I have added comments around the whole code and in every script where I thought I
need to tell whats happening. I have added comments all around so its easy to understand whats happening in that part of the code. The code is made for
Unity Game Engine coded in C# language and free to use and edit. Its reccomended to add all four of the scripts in your project but its all your wish. If
you have a better solutions for anything in the code please make a pull request or issue in the page telling me.
